## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

#### HTML/CSS User Stories
* As a player, I want a main menu that is has a clear structure so that I will be able to navigate the page with ease.
* As a player, I would like to have instruction to the game so that I understand how the game works.
* As a player, I would like to have the game page to be easy to look at so that I won't have trouble playing the game.
* As a player, I want to have a choice of a number games to play so that I can pick one that's best for me.
* As a player, I would like to see the end result of the game so that I can see if I've won I can CELEBRATE or if I've lost, I'll drown my sorrows.
* As a player, I would like a close button on the main menu so that i can choose to close the game quickly and simply.

#### JavaScript User Stories


### Wireframes
Please follow this link to the Wireframes.

Click [here](wireframes.md) and it'll take you straight there!
### Typography
I used Google fonts' "Caveat Brush" for the one and only font for this game. It's a playful and fun font that fits well with a game that is casually played where-ever, whenever and in any decision making process!
### Colour Scheme

#### ColorSpace and Eye Dropper
I used the eye dropper on the image in the background of the front screen and passed the color I'd like to create a palette from, through to ColorSpace.
I then scrolled thorugh to find the best palette for my project. In this case it was "Matching Gradient".

#### ColorSpace color palette, I used the "Matching Gradient" palette

## Features:
Explain your features on the website,(navigation, pages, links, forms.....)
### Navigation
### Footer
### Other features
## Technologies Used
For my project I used; 
* HTML and CSS for the structure of the project.
* Bootstrap helped create a different effect for my buttons. I made sure to put my own spin by changing the color, font and added a border-bottom/right style to create a 3D effect.
* Github is used to store and build my project, the BEST!
* I used Google fonts for a more playful font that'll pair well with my concept (laid-back pub vibe).
* JavaScript
## Testing
Important part of your README!!!
### Google's Lighthouse Performance
Screenshots of certain pages and scores (mobile and desktop)
### Browser Compatibility
Check compatability with different browsers
### Responsiveness
Screenshots of the responsivness, pick few devices (from 320px top 1200px)
### Code Validation
Validate your code HTML, CSS (all pages/files need to be validated!!!), display screenshots
### Manual Testing user stories or/and features
Test all your user stories, you an create table 
User Story |  Test | Pass
--- | --- | :---:
paste here you user story | what is visible to the user and what action they should perform | &check;
- and attach screenshot

## Bugs

### Getting the background image to fit the whole screen
I applied the background image to the HTML page as I'm going to change it when the 'Play game' button is clicked. I then tried working out how to position the image center and so there there wasn't any gaps at the bottom of the page. To do this I applied the following code: **background-position: center center** & **background-attachment: fixed**. This helped position the image in the center of the screen and the attachment is set to fix so that the image stays where it is.

### Google Fonts
After completing my first project and learning about JavaScript, I'd let my knowledge slip a little on how to import the fonts I'd like from Google Fonts and pop them into my project.
I'd placed the import line of code in the CSS stylesheet as usual but I'd also copied and pasted the link to put into the head of the HTML page. After realizing what I'd done. I deleted the link in the HTML and kept import in the CSS stylesheet. I'd then noticed that the the font-family was placed in the HTML element on the stylesheet. I placed that style in the body element instead. The font worked perfect after that, thank god!

## Deployment

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.
#### Deloying on Github
The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.

### User Stories

#### HTML/CSS User Stories
* As a player, I want a main menu that is has a clear structure so that I will be able to navigate the page with ease.
* As a player, I would like to have instruction to the game so that I understand how the game works.
* As a player, I would like to have the game page to be easy to look at so that I won't have trouble playing the game.
* As a player, I want to have a choice of a number games to play so that I can pick one that's best for me.
* As a player, I would like to see the end result of the game so that I can see if I've won I can CELEBRATE or if I've lost, I'll drown my sorrows.
